    <p>This is the unordered list, entitled: It All Seems So Intimidating</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Fun fact: I didn't know you could put nested paragraphs inside of li
        elements.
      </li>
      <li>
        HTML seemed difficult and now I understand it's actually wonderfully
        simple (relatively).
      </li>
      <li>Loss is painful.</li>
      <li>I think I'm going to have fun in this class!</li>

      the text.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sometimes, you want to do <em><strong>both.</strong></em>
    </p>
    <p><h2>Empty Elements</h2></p>
