        <p>Lists!</p>
        <p>This is the unordered list, entitled: It All Seems So Intimidating</p>
        <ul>
            <li>fun fact I didn't know you could put nested paragraphs inside of 
                li elements.</li>
            <li>item2</li>
            <li>item3</li>
            <li>item4</li>
            <li>item5</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This is the ordered list, my top 5 [current] music albums.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>"Hozier", by Hozier</li>
            <li>"Busyhead", by Noah Kahan</li>
            <li>"The Search", by NF</li>
            <li>"Therapy Session", by NF</li>
            <li>"Atlas", by The Score</li>

            of text.</p>
        <p>Sometimes, you want to <strong>strongly</strong>exmphasize something 
            in the text.</p>
        <p>Sometimes, you want to do <em><strong>both.</strong></em></p>

        Soft line breaks can't wrap anything. Neither can image tags, or hard lines.

        Add a hard line under here.<br/>
        
        This page probably doesn't look great - we'll learn how to hook it to 
        CSS next week.
