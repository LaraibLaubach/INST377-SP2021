    <p><h2>Lists!</h2></p>
    <p>This is the unordered list, entitled: It All Seems So Intimidating</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Fun fact: I didn't know you could put nested paragraphs inside of li
        elements.
      </li>
      <li>
        HTML seemed difficult and now I understand it's actually wonderfully
        simple (relatively).
      </li>
      <li>Loss is painful.</li>
      <li>I think I'm going to have fun in this class!</li>
      <li>Item 5</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This is the ordered list, my top 5 [current] music albums.</p>
    <ol>
      <li>"Hozier", by Hozier</li>
      <li>"Busyhead", by Noah Kahan</li>
      <li>"The Search", by NF</li>
      <li>"Therapy Session", by NF</li>
      <li>"Atlas", by The Score</li>
    </ol>

      Sometimes, you want to draw <em>attention</em> to something in a line of
      text.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sometimes, you want to <strong>strongly</strong> emphasize something in
      the text.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sometimes, you want to do <em><strong>both.</strong></em>
    </p>
    <p><h2>Empty Elements</h2></p>
    Soft line breaks can't wrap anything. Neither can image tags, or hard lines.
    Add a hard line under here.<br/>

    This page probably doesn't look great - we'll learn how to hook it to CSS
    next week.
